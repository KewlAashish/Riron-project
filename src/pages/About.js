            Riron was created so that people can have a platform where they can
            share their theories about any topics over the internet. Rather than
            sharing it in a boring platform where people may not give them
            enough attention. Post it somewhere people just come to read what
            thoughts do other people have on some random subject. So go and post
            your thought on some random thought which someone out there may find
            interesting, it could be anything from Kevin Durants loyalty to any
            franchise or on how sasuke is better than itachi. Well we are joking
            both the previous example are extremely fake as they don't exist but
            go on and write and post anything you like. Be Free Be You
